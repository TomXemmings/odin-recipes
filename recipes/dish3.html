        <p>These chocolate thumbprint cookies have a ganache filling that bumps up the rich chocolate flavor and adds a nice creaminess to the cookie.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Â¾ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>STEP 1</h3><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</p></li>
            <li><h3>STEP 2</h3><p>Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until incorporated.</p></li>
            <li><h3>STEP 3</h3><p>Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined. With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating until well combined, about 2 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><h3>STEP 4</h3><p>Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press the center of each ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 1/2-inch wide).</p></li>
            <li><h3>STEP 5</h3><p>Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a time, rotating top to bottom and bottom to top halfway through, until cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 minutes.</p></li>
        </ol>
